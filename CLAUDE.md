# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python sandbox project for experimenting with LangGraph. The project is in its initial setup phase with minimal dependencies and a basic entry point.

## Development Setup

The project uses:
- Python >=3.10
- pyproject.toml for dependency management

## Commands

### Running the application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Installing dependencies (if any are added)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Code Architecture

Currently minimal with:
- `main.py`: Entry point with basic hello world functionality
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration with no dependencies yet

This appears to be a fresh project ready for LangGraph implementation and experimentation.
